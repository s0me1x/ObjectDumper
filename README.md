# ObjectDumper
"Utility methods to easily dump object contents to a file/stream, for debug purposes."

## History
The original source code is said to be a part of code samples included in older versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. (CSharpSamples/LinkSamples)

Supposedly, this [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ObjectDumper) by Lasse V. Karlsen of Microsoft, is using the original Microsoft's code.

The original code was then modified by [ms007@StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/262235) on April 14, 2014, then modified again by [Brent@StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1022710) on September 15, 2014, as mentioned in [stackoverflow question #852181](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/852181).

[Brent@StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1022710)==[mcshaz@GitHub](https://github.com/mcshaz) has his version of ObjectDumper class as a part of his WPF project [here](https://github.com/mcshaz/BlowTrial/blob/master/GenericToDataFile/ObjectDumper.cs).  It seems [mcshaz@GitHub](https://github.com/mcshaz) has modified the code further in the commit he did on August 22, 2017.

I copied [mcshaz@GitHub](https://github.com/mcshaz)'s version of ObjectDumper to this repository on January 13, 2023, to put it in a repository of its own.
